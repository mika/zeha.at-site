title: "Austrian iPhone 4S plan index"
---

Some of the austrian carriers have announced prices for the 4S. The plan index has been updated to reflect that.

Expect updates when new info becomes available, but I won't announce these here.

What can be said nevertheless: carrier prices still won't be cheaper than buying the phone unlocked plus a cheap plan.

Also, smartbob ends 31/10. If you want to go this route you should hurry.
