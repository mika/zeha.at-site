After a very long time, <a href="http://doc.powerdns.com/changelog.html#CHANGELOG-AUTH-2-9-22">PowerDNS 2.9.22</a> has <a href="http://blog.netherlabs.nl/articles/2009/01/27/powerdns-2-9-22-released-rfc-5452-assigned">been released</a> by it's author; a release I've been looking forward to because of various issues.<br /><br />Unfortunately this is too late for the Debian lenny release, so I'll probably need to maintain custom packages for both etch &amp; lenny.<br />
