title: Why we're using GRML in the datacenter

<a href="http://grml.org/">grml</a> basically is a live Linux CD optimized for text-tool users and sysadmins. We are using it in the datacenter, and here's why:<br /><br /><ul><li>It's a breeze to use for unprepared tasks: it contains a lot of useful tools, and it's just a CD you need to carry. Got a broken machine? Suddenly some box is acting strange? Fire up grml and check what's going on.</li><li>It's easy to integrate into your existing infrastructure. You probably already have some PXE server for network booting, and you can boot grml off it after <a href="http://wiki.grml.org/doku.php?id=terminalserver#booting_grml_without_grml-terminalserver">following a few simple steps</a>.</li><li>It's easy to extend. We've just recently replaced our old preseeded debian installer for deploying new machines with grml (from PXE boot) + a simple script I wrote in an hour or so. <br /></li><li>It supports all our hardware.</li><li>The grml64 variant is a true 64-bit Linux, which is great if you want to deploy 64-bit installations.</li><li>It's based on Debian, so our people are already familiar with the environment.<br /></li></ul>Try grml out - grab your copy of grml or grml64 <a href="http://grml.org/download/">from here</a>.<br /><br />Also, grml provides a nice pre-configured zsh (and related shell environment). If you like it, you may want to use it permanently for your workstation (or even servers). Get the instructions from <a href="http://grml.org/console/">http://grml.org/console/</a>
