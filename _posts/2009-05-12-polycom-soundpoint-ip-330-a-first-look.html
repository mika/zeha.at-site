Provisioning "just worked" as documented on the web, as well as the PoE, SIP, firmware upgrade (which is really just part of the provisioning), dialing stuff, etc. German translation is included, but it's (like on all SIP phones) very confusing.</div><div><br /></div><div>But it's already less confusing than the Snom 360 I was previously using.</div>
