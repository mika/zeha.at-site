title: "Introducing pbundler"
---

[pbundler](http://github.com/zeha/pbundler/) is the "Python Bundler".

pbundler is inspired by the great [bundler for Ruby](http://gembundler.com/), which serves the mission of making development in Ruby easier.

pbundler aims to do the same for Python.

In version 0.0.1, just released to PyPI, pbundler is just a thin wrapper over virtualenv and pip. Both are tools you probably already use for your Python development, and rightfully so.
If you've been following recent best practices, your projects will already have a "requirements.txt" as well.

With all of this in place, you, your development peers and your interested users can just run "pbundle" after cloning your project's source code, and are ready to run.
