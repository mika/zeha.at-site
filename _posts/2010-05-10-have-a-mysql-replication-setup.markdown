If so, you should invest some time in research of tools already available.

At least, you should consider using [MaatKit](http://www.maatkit.org):

> Most of Maatkit's functionality is designed for MySQL.  It makes MySQL easier and safer to manage. It provides simple, predictable ways to do things you cannot otherwise do. That's why Maatkit is now shipping by default with many GNU/Linux distributions such as Debian and CentOS.  You can use Maatkit to prove replication is working correctly, fix corrupted data, automate repetitive tasks, speed up your servers, and much more.

I found it especially useful in MySQL Replication Setups. mk-table-checksum and mk-table-sync will save you headaches in this scenarios.
