At work we've now successfully switched from an Alcatel OmniPCX Enterprise to a VoIP-/SIP-based solution. This has worked pretty well, some users were excited, some not so (as always).<div><br /></div><div>We're not even missing features, and it's way better for us to handle now. (Even as the LDAP-backed provisioning is still missing right now.)</div><div><br /></div><div>Overall summary basically boils down to:</div><div><ul><li><a href="http://www.freeswitch.org/" style="text-decoration: underline; ">Freeswitch</a>&nbsp;(inside OpenVZ on a HP ProLiant)</li><li><a href="http://www.polycom.com/products/voice/desktop_solutions/soundpoint/desk_phones/soundpoint_ip321_331.html" style="text-decoration: underline; ">Polycom 331 hardware phones</a></li><li>Some users are running twinkle instead</li><li><a href="http://www.polycom.com/support/voice/soundpoint_ip/applications/corporate_directory_access.html">LDAP-based directory</a> on the Polycom phones (needs a software license though)</li><li>Phones are provisioned via DHCP+HTTP, they automatically switch to the Voice VLAN after getting their initial DHCP lease</li><li>PoE</li><li>LDAP-based provisioning of Users&nbsp;(not yet ready, but real soon now)</li></ul></div><div><a href="http://www.freeswitch.org/" style="text-decoration: underline; "></a></div><div><br /></div><div>Of course, all of this was&nbsp;made possible &amp; implemented&nbsp;mostly by my colleagues, not by myself.</div>
