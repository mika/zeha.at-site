After >5 years with some old-style Siemens vacuum cleaner, I've now replaced it with a Dyson DC32.

Pros:

 - The normal strainer is very effective, especially on carpets
 - Bar/staff is rather flexible -> more freedom for cleaning under the bed
 - Very long cable -> more freedom

Cons:

 - Very loud
 - Getting the bin clean afterwards is a bit challenging. Might not be a problem compared to normal vacuum cleaners though (which also tend to be full of dust after replacing the dustbag)
 - Needs more stowing space
