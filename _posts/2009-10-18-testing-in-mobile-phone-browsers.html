title: Testing in mobile phone browsers

Browsers on mobile phones are a <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2009/10/there_is_no_web.html">pain</a>. It feels a bit like the old browser wars, except that there are no fights.<div><br /></div><div>Testing all those browsers is even more painfully: you'd need one physical device for each released mobile phone OS + version out there. <a href="http://twitter.com/PPK">PPK</a> can do this, but you probably don't have all those devices.</div><div><br /></div><div>So, what about emulating...?</div><div><br /></div><div>Yeah. It works for Android.</div><div><br /></div><div>The Android SDK (free download!) actually contains an emulator which seems to run the original binaries. You can also hook up a debugger (adb logcat) to the emulated device, and start debugging javascript in the browser. Nice. (Also on Mac.)</div><div><br /></div><div>The iPhone SDK (<a href="http://developer.apple.com/iphone/">free download from Apple</a>. Mac only) contains a simulator: the "device" will run x86 code, so it's not the same as the physical device to start with. I need to check if the browser behaves the same as on the phone.</div><div><br /></div><div>For Symbian phones, you need to download a Symbian / <a href="http://www.forum.nokia.com/Tools_Docs_and_Code/Tools/Platforms/S60_Platform_SDKs/">Series60 SDK</a> from Nokia (<i>forum.nokia.com</i> - how weird is that? After 14 days you need to register it). It's Win32 only, and again only a simulator which runs x86 code. It didn't work at all on my Windows 7 desktop. (Also it's the SDK with the strangest feeling. I can fully understand why no one is developing apps for S60.)</div><div><br /></div>
