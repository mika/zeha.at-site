<div>Vienna has a relatively small data center density compared to other cities, but there are still a few options worth exploring:</div><div><br /></div><div><a href="http://www.danubedc.com/">DanubeDC</a>, Floridsdorf: very competent looking, fast interaction possible. They build a second DC on the south side of the Danube, too, probably with high-density cooling zones.</div><div><br /></div><div><div><a href="http://www.ibm.com/contact/at/de/" style="text-decoration: underline; ">IBM</a> ODC21, Floridsdorf: Bureaucracy; fast; very competent looking. Can do high-density cooling zones.</div><div><br /></div></div><div><a href="http://www.interxion.at/">InterXion</a>, Floridsdorf: "the datacenter". VIX2 is hosted here. A bureaucracy. Can do large-scale projects, as well as high-density cooling zones.</div><div><br /></div><div><a href="http://www.interoute.com/">interoute</a>, Liesing</div><div><br /></div><div><a href="http://invitel-int.com/">Invitel</a>, Voesendorf: Can do large-scale projects, unfortunately not directly located in Vienna.</div><div><br /></div><div><a href="http://www.nessus.at/">Nessus</a>, Favoriten: probably very flexible, small company.</div><div><br /></div><div><a href="http://www.sil.at/">SIL</a>, Heiligenstadt: okay. Sometimes a pita, but things get better.</div><div><br /></div><div><a href="http://www6.inode.at/typo3/produkte/housing/inode-housing/inode-housing/">UPC</a>, Favoriten: probably okay. Flexible pricing.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>There are rumors that Verizon and Telia also operate data centers in Vienna, but I couldn't get pricing/info from them.</div><div><br /></div><div>Most data centers offer reasonable pricing while not being capable of doing proper pre-sales. You better know exactly what you want ahead of calling/visiting anyone.</div>
