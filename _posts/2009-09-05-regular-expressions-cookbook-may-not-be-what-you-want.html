I bought <a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596520687/">this book</a> for reasons I cannot remember, and I can't see why I did this in the first place. The intro chapters are not very useful, they do not cover anything besides 'Perl-style regexes' (they do cover differences between different Perl-style RE implementations though).<div>I'll probably keep it as a reference, if I ever need an RE for an already solved problem <b>and</b> Google would fail me.&nbsp;</div>
