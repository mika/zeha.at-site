During my recent mini-talk I suggested, that one should always use the latest version of puppet.<div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><br /></span></div><div>But, our own production setup was still on 0.24.4.&nbsp;</div><div>Yep, 0.24.<b>4</b>.</div><div>That old.</div><div><br /></div><div>This got us into some trouble during deployment of the Nagios/Naginator types (in 0.24.4+0.24.5 they are dead slow and missing features which make them unusable). Therefore, we've now upgraded to 0.24.8 and enjoy fast deployment of those types :-)</div>
