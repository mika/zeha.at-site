title: Backwards incompatible change in Firefox 3.0.13
mt_id: 51

Seems like Firefox 3.0.13 has been released, as well as the updates for
Ubuntu, probably fixing the BlackHat related SSL problems.<br /><br />This is of course fine, but the fix seems to have broken behavior we've relied on for all too long: <br /><br />Previously,
given a certificate for *.domain.com, this would (in Firefox, not in
other browsers) also be valid for a host called "foo.bar.domain.com".
As of 3.0.13 this is no longer true, and therefore we're getting loads
of SSL errors now...<br /><br />(I've not validated this with Firefox on Windows.)<br />
