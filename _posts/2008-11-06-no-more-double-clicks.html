title: No more double-clicks

During a shower thought, I realized that I'm no longer double-clicking, for the most of my computer usage.<br />What are double clicks useful for? Maximizing windows, opening files, starting apps, etc.<br />But I'm just not doing this stuff any more - window management is only a keyboard thingie with <a href="http://xmonad.org/">xmonad</a>, maximizing windows on OS X is a single-click anyway, and on Windows I've moved to using the (single-click) buttons, too.<br />The other tasks are pretty much non-existent with xmonad (and no "desktop manager").<br />On OS X app starts only come via quicksilver/the dock; opening files can also be done using drag&amp;drop and I'm increasingly doing this.<br /><br />
