title: "Grml packages in Debian"
---

The first fruits of our push packages to Debian effort are now available in
Debian. Three often used packages from the Grml Team have arrived in unstable:

* [grml2usb](http://packages.debian.org/grml2usb)
* [grml-debootstrap](http://packages.debian.org/grml-debootstrap)
* [grml-rescueboot](http://packages.debian.org/grml-rescueboot)

[Packages overview for Grml Team](http://qa.debian.org/developer.php?login=team%40grml.org)

Note that these packages are no longer part of the grml-testing distribution.

To get the current version of any of these packages you *must* get them from
Debian unstable instead. If this is a problem for you, please come to the
[grml mailing list](http://grml.org/mailinglist/).
